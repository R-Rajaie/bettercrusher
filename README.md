# Usage

This is a shell script that can be used to spam either the same, or randomized messages to any specified channel in the server.
Messages are sent at a 1 second interval to circumvent both discord rate limiting, and spam protection from bots.
Multiple instances of this script can be run simultaneously on different Discord tokens, allowing it to make up for the 1 second delay between messages.
This script also has the option to set the users nick name to a random letter (within a certain range to prevent it from showing up too high in the member list) at 1 second intervals.
There is also the option to either run both the message spammer and the nickname scrambler simultaneously, or one seperately.

Pinging users: <@userid>
Pinging roles: <@&roleid>

THIS WAS MADE JUST FOR FUN. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT TO BREAK DISCORD TOS.
